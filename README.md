 Coding Assessment for Sales Boomerang


### Setup
I decided to use MySQL to store the colors so you'll need to create a table for them. I added the necessary SQL under ./server/config/createTable.sql.
Running those scripts will create the table and insert all the necessary colors.
The MySQL credentials can be set in /server/db.config.js. At the moment the password is gibberish.

## Initialize App
To install the dependencies run ```npm run build```

To start the app be in the root directory and run ```npm run dev```
